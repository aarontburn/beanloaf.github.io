# Cool Features
Uses Python to access the Spotify API, which generates a list of all my releases. With that information, it changes the latest release feature on the home page as well as generating individual song pages for each release when clicked on in the library page. While this isn't fully autonomous, all you need to do is run a Python script and it does all the heavy lifting.
